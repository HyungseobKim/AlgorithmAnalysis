Convex hull brute force 1 :
Check all possible edges, so all other points are inside of the edge.

Convex hull brute force 2 :
Find first possible edge, and find the next vertex of the hull in counter-clockwise order.
Check edge always contains last vertex added on hull, and determin whether all other points are left of edge.
